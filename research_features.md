## Best practices:
- Try to use as much as high contrast as possible so text or blocks won’t blend too much into the background
- When graphs are displaying, be aware that a legend is usually based on color. Try to make use of patterns or shapes besides color-only as they can be distinguished too, even if the user is color blind.
- When selecting tickets for a show/performance and having to choose a seat, have the price/kind of seats distinguished by something other than color-only.

**Image loading**

![Surprisingly, Unsplash is [probably] first loading the originally uploaded profile picture in full size and then makes a thumbnail out of it on the spot. Then, the thumbnail is uploaded.](https://d2mxuefqeaa7sj.cloudfront.net/s_5BF35D1240A6D563DE719889CCC922379A8F175CC8108DCC3210A213401458E4_1552311642858_Screenshot+2019-03-11+at+14.40.01.png)


When you’re visiting a profile-page on Unsplash, one of the first things that’s loaded is the profile picture. What’s remarkable is that they first load the originally uploaded picture (full-size), then make a thumbnail out of it, then upload the thumbnail again. This seems to be a bit devious as it’s a bit unnecessary to load the same image twice (especially if the first image is full-size and six times as big as the thumbnail. Why not convert the profile pic to a thumbnail right away when it’s uploaded by the user of that page? Saves data, saves loading time.
