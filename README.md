# Shopping List

## The Design Challenge // Use Case
* Ik wil boodschappen-om-tostis-te-maken in mijn boodschappenlijstje kunnen gooien.

* I want to add 'groceries-to-make-grilled-cheese' to my shopping list.

## Functionality
By using this website, you can put your own Shopping List together and add pre-made lists (e.g. for making ommelettes, spaghetti, etc) to them, too. Whilst shopping, you can check those items off.

## Features/Browser Technologies
What I did to enhance inclusiveness:

#### Images not available
Use alt-text (even it's an unimportant image, then leave it empty "")

#### Custom fonts turned off
Fallback on the default fonts; serif/serif

#### Javascript turned off
Write HTML semantically and make sure everything already works *before* getting to JavaScript
- [x] Made everything server-side.

#### Colorblindness (disable color)
Test with Colorblindly, make sure the contrast is big enough and make use of patterns/hover aswell when using color as part of a legenda

#### Slow internet (turn off broadwidth)
Test in console>network. Make sure the core functionalities load first.

#### Cookies turned off

#### localStorage disabled

#### Mouse/trackpad does't work
Write HTML semantically correct and test with screenreaders

## Features supported by which browsers
Some of my features on top of the core functionalities will only work in specific browsers. Below you'll find which one would work in which browser.
