# BrokeSmoke

## The Design Challenge // Use Case
* Ik wil bij kunnen houden hoeveel sigaretten ik (vanaf het moment van minderen met roken) bespaar, wel rook, laat bietsen en wat de financiÃ«le gevolgen hiervan zijn.

* I want to track my smoking habits from the moment of quitting and what the financial outcome of this is.

## Functionality
By using this website, you can track how many cigarettes you chose not to smoke, you chose to smoke and how many you gave away to others. You'll also be able to see how much money you saved or spent from the moment you smoked less.

## Features/Browser Technologies
What I did to enhance inclusiveness:


#### Images not available
Use alt-text (even it's an unimportant image, then leave it empty "")

#### Custom fonts turned off
Fallback on the default fonts; serif/serif

#### Javascript turned off
Write HTML semantically and make sure everything already works *before* getting to JavaScript
- [x] Made everything server-side.

#### Colorblindness (disable color)
Test with Colorblindly, make sure the contrast is big enough and make use of patterns/hover aswell when using color as part of a legenda

#### Slow internet (turn off broadwidth)
Test in console>network. Make sure the core functionalities load first.

#### Cookies turned off

#### localStorage disabled

#### Mouse/trackpad does't work
Write HTML semantically correct and test with screenreaders
