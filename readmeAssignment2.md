# Shopping List

## The Design Challenge // Use Case
* Ik wil boodschappen-om-tostis-te-maken in mijn boodschappenlijstje kunnen gooien.

* I want to add 'groceries-to-make-grilled-cheese' to my shopping list.

## Functionality
By using this website, you can put your own Shopping List together and add pre-made lists (e.g. for making ommelettes, spaghetti, etc) to them, too. Whilst shopping, you can check those items off.

## Features/Browser Technologies
What I did to enhance inclusiveness:

#### Images not available
Use alt-text (even it's an unimportant image, then leave it empty "")

#### Custom fonts turned off
Fallback on the default fonts; serif/serif

#### Javascript turned off
Write HTML semantically and make sure everything already works *before* getting to JavaScript
- [x] Made everything server-side.

#### Colorblindness (disable color)
Test with Colorblindly, make sure the contrast is big enough and make use of patterns/hover aswell when using color as part of a legenda

#### Slow internet (turn off broadwidth)
Test in console>network. Make sure the core functionalities load first.

#### Cookies turned off

#### localStorage disabled

#### Mouse/trackpad does't work
Write HTML semantically correct and test with screenreaders

## Features supported by which browsers
